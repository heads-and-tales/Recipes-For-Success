BANANA FUDGE CAKE RECIPE 

INGREDIENTS
1 package (18-1/4 ounces) chocolate fudge cake mix
1 large ripe banana, mashed
FROSTING:
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/4 cup water
5-1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, divided
1/4 cup baking cocoa
1 small ripe banana, mashed
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

DIRECTIONS
In a mixing bowl, prepare cake mix according to package directions, omitting 1/4 cup of the water. Beat on low speed until moistened. Add banana; beat on high for 2 minutes. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. baking pan. Bake at 350Â° for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool completely. In a saucepan, heat butter and water until butter is melted; set aside. In a mixing bowl, combine 4 cups confectioners' sugar and cocoa. Add butter mixture, banana and vanilla; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining sugar until frosting reaches desired spreading consistency. Frost the cake. Yield: 12-15 servings.
